# Elements SandBox
***Or for short ESB***

<p>Do you remember those good old Flash "Sandbox" games where you could fuck around by spawning "elements" like sand, water, ETC.? Yeah so I got really nostalgic about them so I made a modern version. I have been working on it for a while now, it's still not perfect but what matters is that it's kind of fun (<i>I guess</i>).</p>
